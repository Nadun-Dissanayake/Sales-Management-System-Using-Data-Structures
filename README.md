Overview
------------
Data structures and algorithms help build sales management systems by providing reusability
and abstraction. Using appropriate data structures can help save a reasonable amount of time while
performing operations like storage, retrieval, or processing of data, and manipulation of large amounts
of data are easier.

The traditional way for retailer keeps their sales and inventory details is by using spreadsheets
which are no longer effective as the size of the shop gets bigger. This reason is that more items will
be made available in larger quantities. So, tracking the sales made with inventory level in the business
would be complicated and time-consuming for the retailer. Besides, the situation worsens when the
retailer does not have a proper method to determine items bought by their customers.

Objectives
-----------
This sales management system aims to increase sales volume, contributing to company profits and an
organization’s long-term growth. One of the other objective of sales management is generating revenue for the
organization. The sales department is solely responsible for bringing in the money.
Another objective we can mention here is to increase Sales Volume. Therefore, the organization wishes
to increase the number of units sold through efficient sales management. This will ensure that the production
facilities do not remain idle and are utilized to the fullest.

Methodology
------------
The proposed system is designed and implemented using the data structures and algorithms approach.
The sales management systems are becoming more complex, and the amount of data is increasing daily, which
may cause problems with process speed, searching data, handling multiple requests, etc. The data items can be
traversed easily with the help of data structure and algorithms. Data structure provides efficiency, reusability,
and abstraction. It plays a vital role in enhancing a program's performance because its primary function is to
store and retrieve the user’s data as quickly as possible. The programming language for this project is C++
using Visual Studio 2020. Most competitive programmers use C++ because it efficiently uses data structures
and algorithms. That said, the language is just a medium, and any wording we are affluent with is appropriate
for you to implement DSA
